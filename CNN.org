* Features

CNNs compare images piece by piece. The pieces that it looks for are called
features. By finding rough feature matches in roughly the same positions in two
images, CNNs get a lot better at seeing similarity than whole-image matching
schemes.

* Convolution

+ CNN will try to match the feature everywhere and in every possible position.
+ In calculating the match to a feature across the whole image, we call it a *filter*
+ to calculate the match of a feature to a patch of the image, simply multiply
  each pixel in the feature by the value of the corresponding pixel in the image
+ then add up the values and divide by the total number of pixels
+ to complete convolution, repeat the process, lining up the feature with every
  possible image patch
+ values close to 1 show strong matches, close to -1 indicate photographic
  negative of our feature, 0 means no match

* Pooling

- way to take large images and shrink them down while preserving the most
  important information
- stepping a small window across an image and taking the maximum value from the
  window as each step.

* Fully Connected Layers

- take high level filtered images and translates them into votes
- we have decide between X categories
- some values are better than others in classifying a particular class, these
  get larger votes than others
- these votes are expressed as weights or connection strengths
